# XenoverseWikiScripts
## A collection of scripts to help update the unofficial English wiki for the fan game Pokémon Xenoverse

### Notice
I am neither a professional coder nor particularly good at it. If you have any recommendations or advice, please make an issue or contact me directly. I am always looking to improve my skills!

### Warning
This project is not meant as a total replacement to manual editing, and should be used with caution. It is not perfect and may not always produce the desired results, especially if there are special cases I have not accounted for. It is recommended to check the output of the scripts before pasting them into the wiki. If you run into any errors/issues, please contact me.

Note: especially check Availability box outputs, it is the most likely to have errors. Opening paragraph is a major WIP.
### Features & Planned
Generates Pokémon wiki pages for Xenoverse 1.5.5, and currently:
- Supports all Pokémon found in the main Pokédex, the Xenodex, and the Vintagedex.
- Extracts the abilities, wild held items, metric height and weight, base exp, base stats, gender code, growth rate, EV yield, egg groups & steps, friendship, and catch rate for a Pokémon from the game files.
- Finds the English species name and dex entry for display.
- Calculates the effectiveness of other types against a given Pokémon, including the Sound type, and accounting for abilities.
- Extracts all moves learnable by a Pokémon through level up, TMs, breeding, or tutoring, account for STAB.
- Finds information about wild encounters and static encounters and displays with appropriate rarity.
- Account for evolutions and related aspects (egg moves of previous evolutions, future STAB, in the evolution box, in the opening paragraph, or if egg hatching is possible).
- Matches up information in the game files to pre-made reference dictionaries for correct, English display and other related information.
- Prints all results to the console in wiki-applicable code and according to the style and templates currently found on the unofficial English wiki.

It does not yet, and may never:
- Find the fathers for applicable egg moves.

### Acknowledgements
I would like to thank N for his help and work in compiling game information for my use, and Phye for her stellar advice and game & wiki knowledge I most desperately needed.

This is a personal project made with intent to help my own contributions to the [unofficial english wiki](https://pokemon-xenoverse.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon) of the Pokémon-based fan game, Xenoverse: Per Aspera Ad Astra, developed by WEEDle. Neither I nor this project are related to [Xenoverse: Per Aspera Ad Astra](https://www.weedleteam.com/wp/) or the [official Italian wiki](https://xenoverse-per-aspera-ad-astra.fandom.com/it/wiki/Xenoverse:_Per_Aspera_Ad_Astra_Wiki).
