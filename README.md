# XenoverseWikiScripts
## A collection of scripts to help update the unofficial english wiki for the fan game Pokémon Xenoverse

### Features & Planned
Generates Pokémon wiki pages for Xenoverse 1.5.5, and currently:
- Supports all Pokémon found in the main Pokédex and the Xenodex.
- Extracts the abilities, wild held items, metric height and weight, base stats, gender code, growth rate, EV yield, egg groups & steps, friendship, and catch rate for a Pokémon from the game files.
- Calculates and accounts for the effectiveness of other types against a given Pokémon, including the Sound type.
- Extracts all moves learnable by a Pokémon through level up, TMs, breeding, or tutoring, account for STAB.
- Finds information about wild encounters and displays with appropriate rarity.
- Matches up information in the game files to pre-made reference dictionaries for correct, English display and other related information.
- Prints all results to the console in wiki-applicable code and according to the style and templates currently found on the unofficial English wiki.

It does not yet, and may never:
- Account for evolutions and related aspects (egg moves of previous evolutions, future STAB, in the evolution box, in the opening paragraph, or if egg hatching is possible) .
- Indicate the Pokémon's species or Pokédex entries, as only the Italian versions are easily available.
- Find the fathers for applicable egg moves.
- Completely function for the Vintagedex (I plan to implement this, but there are some unresolved discrepancies between the wiki and the game data for vintage Pokémon).
- Account for static encounters (planned).

### Disclaimer
This is a personal project made with intent to help my own contributions to the [unofficial english wiki](https://pokemon-xenoverse.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon) of the Pokémon-based fan game Xenoverse: Per Aspera Ad Astra, developed by WEEDle. Neither I nor this project are related to [Xenoverse: Per Aspera Ad Astra](https://www.weedleteam.com/wp/) or the [official Italian wiki](https://xenoverse-per-aspera-ad-astra.fandom.com/it/wiki/Xenoverse:_Per_Aspera_Ad_Astra_Wiki).
